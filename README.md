### Prerequisites

1. You must [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it.
2. You must [create a Shopify partner account](https://partners.shopify.com/signup) if you donâ€™t have one.
3. You must create a store for testing if you don't have one, either a [development store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/development-stores#create-a-development-store) or a [Shopify Plus sandbox store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/managing-stores/plus-sandbox-store).

### Setup

If you used the CLI to create the template, you can skip this section.

Using yarn:

```shell
yarn install
```

Using npm:

```shell
npm install
```

Using pnpm:

```shell
pnpm install
```

### Local Development

Using yarn:

```shell
yarn dev
```

Using npm:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Using pnpm:

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

Press P to open the URL to your app. Once you click install, you can start development.

Local development is powered by [the Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli). It logs into your partners account, connects to an app, provides environment variables, updates remote config, creates a tunnel and provides commands to generate extensions.

### Authenticating and querying data

To authenticate and query data you can use the `shopify` const that is exported from `/app/shopify.server.js`:

```js
export async function loader({ request }) {
  const { admin } = await shopify.authenticate.admin(request);

  const response = await admin.graphql(`
    {
      products(first: 25) {
        nodes {
          title
          description
        }
      }
    }`);

  const {
    data: {
      products: { nodes },
    },
  } = await response.json();

  return json(nodes);
}
```

This template come preconfigured with examples of:

1. Setting up your Shopify app in [/app/shopify.server.js](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix/blob/main/app/shopify.server.js)
2. Querying data using Graphql. Please see: [/app/routes/app.\_index.jsx](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix/blob/main/app/routes/app._index.jsx).
3. Responding to mandatory webhooks in [/app/routes/webhooks.jsx](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix/blob/main/app/routes/webhooks.jsx)

Please read the [documentation for @shopify/shopify-app-remix](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/shopify-app-remix#authenticating-admin-requests) to understand what other API's are available.
